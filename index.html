  <div>
    <span>
  <p>The two boys Chron and Ren were best friends since their childhood. The two grew older and decided to become secret agents. Then during a dangerous mission, Chron and Ren were both greatly injured. When escaping, a bullet was shot towards Chron, but Ren steps in front of Chron blocking the shot. Backup came, but it was too late, Ren is dead.</p>
  </span>
  <span>
<p>Chron quits his job the next day due to the pain and the feeling that it was all his fault. Chron believes in resurrection, so he did research on that for a whole year until he found a book that records a mysterious event where time travel happened. It was said to be caused by an hourglass located inside a Maya temple.</p>

<p>Chron sets out on an adventure to find the hourglass and travel back in time to prevent the death of his best friend.</p>
